# Project automation script for M65C02 
# 
# Created for ISE version 10.1
# 
# This file contains several Tcl procedures (procs) that you can use to automate
# your project by running from xtclsh or the Project Navigator Tcl console.
# If you load this file (using the Tcl command: source C:/XProjects/ISE10.1i/M65C02/Src/M65C02.tcl, then you can
# run any of the procs included here.
# You may also edit any of these procs to customize them. See comments in each
# proc for more instructions.
# 
# This file contains the following procedures:
# 
# Top Level procs (meant to be called directly by the user):
#    run_process: you can use this top-level procedure to run any processes
#        that you choose to by adding and removing comments, or by
#        adding new entries.
#    rebuild_project: you can alternatively use this top-level procedure
#        to recreate your entire project, and the run selected processes.
# 
# Lower Level (helper) procs (called under in various cases by the top level procs):
#    show_help: print some basic information describing how this script works
#    add_source_files: adds the listed source files to your project.
#    set_project_props: sets the project properties that were in effect when this
#        script was generated.
#    create_libraries: creates and adds file to VHDL libraries that were defined when
#        this script was generated.
#    create_partitions: adds any partitions that were defined when this script was generated.
#    set_process_props: set the process properties as they were set for your project
#        when this script was generated.

# the Implement Design and Generate Programming File processes by default. This proc
# also sets process properties as specified in the "set_process_props" proc. Only
# those properties which have values different from their current settings in the project
# file will be modified in the project.

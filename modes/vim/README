To get key-bindings for fl include the line

source <path_to_VossII>/modes/vim/fl.vimrc   in your ~/.vimrc file

You now get some useful key bindings:

@f (or @F) start fl
@q (or @Q) quit fl

@@	    send the current line to fl
@}	    send from the current line to end of paragraph to fl
@{	    send from the beginning of the current paragraph to the current line
@z (or @Z)  send from the current line to the mark z to fl
@a (or @A)  send from the mark a to the mark z to fl

@?	    print out help for the symbol at the current location

@o (or @O)  open a window that has all of fl's stdout so far.

fl-mode
=======

An Emacs mode for VossII.


Installation
------------

Either drop `fl-mode.el` into a directory that's already on your Emacs load
path, or load it in your config file: `(load "path/to/fl-mode.el")`.

Out of the box, fl-mode will be automatically activated for all `.fl` files.


Commands
--------

fl-mode makes the following commands available to the user.

* `fl-mode`
    - Starts fl-mode, sets up syntax highlighting, etc. for the current buffer.
* `fl-start`
    - Starts an fl session. Does nothing if one is already running.
* `fl-stop`
    - Gracefully shuts the currently running fl session down.
* `fl-kill`
    - Attempt to `fl-stop` the currently running fl session, and
      forcefully kill it if unsuccessful.
* `fl-restart`
    - Restart the currently running fl session.
* `fl-send`
    - Send an interactively read fl expression to the currently running
      fl session.
* `fl-send-line`
    - Sends the current line to the currently running fl session.
* `fl-send-region`
    - Sends the selected region to the currently running fl session.
* `fl-send-buffer`
    - Sends the entire current buffer to the currently running fl session.
* `fl-send-smart`
    - Sends the current selection to the currently running fl session.
      If nothing is selected, instead sends the current line.
* `fl-send-phrase`
	- Sends the phrase around point to the currently running fl
      session, then moves point to the line following that phrase.
* `fl-clear`
    - Clears the fl output buffer.
* `fl-describe`
    - Displays fl help text about the symbol at the cursor.
* `fl-help`
    - Open fl's graphical help window.
* `fl-preferences`
    - Open fl's preferences window.
* `fl-toggle-window`
    - Toggles the visibility of the fl interpreter window.
* `fl-show-window`
    - Displays the fl interpreter window.
* `fl-hide-window`
    - Hides the fl interpreter window.


Default keymap
--------------

By default, the following key mappings are installed:

* `C-f C-f`: evaluate the current selection or line.
* `C-f C-b`: evaluate the current buffer.
* `C-f C-e`: evaluate an interactively entered expression.
* `C-f C-n`: evaluate the phrase surrounding point.
* `C-f C-s`: start an fl session.
* `C-f C-q`: gracefully terminate an fl session.
* `C-f C-k`: forcefully kill an fl session.
* `C-f C-r`: restart the fl session.
* `C-f C-c`: clear the fl buffer.
* `C-f C-d`: display fl help text about the symbol at the cursor.
* `C-f C-h`: open fl's graphical help window.
* `C-f C-p`: open fl's preferences window.
* `C-f C-p`: toggle fl's interpreter window.

Basically, view `C-f` as the "fl-mode hotkey" and the rest (hopefully) makes
sense.


Configuration options
---------------------

fl-mode has several options to tailor its mode of operation.
To modify, `(setq option value)` before running any fl-mode commands.

* `fl-autostart-repl`
    - Should `fl-mode` start an fl session if none is running?
    - Default: `t`
* `fl-binary-path`
    - Path to the `fl` binary directory.
    - Default: `nil` (hoping that it already exists on `exec-path`)
* `fl-kill-delay`
    - How many seconds should `fl-kill` wait for graceful termination
      before deciding that fl is not responding and killing it?
    - Default: `0.5`
* `fl-mode-hooks`
    - Any hooks to run when fl-mode starts.
    - Default: `nil`
* `fl-mode-map`
    - Local key bindings for fl-mode.
    - Default: see _default keymap_ section.
* `fl-mostly-headless`
    - Don't show the main fl window (i.e. only use `*fl*` buffer for text
      output). Graphical features (`STE_debug`) still work as usual.
    - Default: `t`
* `fl-repl-buffer`
    - Name of the buffer to which fl output is written.
    - Default: `"fl-output"`
* `fl-repl-mode`
    - Enable fl-mode hotkeys and syntax highlighting in fl repl buffer?
    - Default: `t`
* `fl-temp-directory`
    - Temporary directory to use for communication with fl.
      Must be an absolute path.
    - Default: `"/tmp"`


Syntax highlighting
-------------------

Out of the box, the following mappings between fl identifier classes and
font lock faces are installed:

* Keywords and built-in symbols (parens, `=`, etc.): `font-lock-keyword-face`
* Built-in functions and operators: `font-lock-builtin-face`
* Quoted expressions (i.e. `'foo`, `'+'`): `font-lock-variable-name-face`


TODO
----

* Special syntax highlighting for colored symbolic vars (`"b0"`/`"r0"`)?
